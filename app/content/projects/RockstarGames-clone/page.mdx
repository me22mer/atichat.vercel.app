This project is an ongoing clone of the RockstarGames website, currently featuring a responsive and visually faithful recreation of the landing page. As my skills grow, so will this project.

### What's Implemented So Far

- **Responsive Landing Page**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Visual Accuracy**: Closely mimics the design and layout of the original RockstarGames landing page.
- **Basic Animations**: Incorporates initial animations to enhance user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Leveraging server-side rendering for optimal performance
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and code quality
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employing utility-first styling for rapid development
- **shadcn/ui**: Utilizing accessible UI components for consistent design
- **Framer Motion**: Implementing smooth animations and transitions
- **Vercel**: Hosting the project for easy access and continuous deployment

Through this ongoing project, I'm actively learning:

1. Recreating complex, modern web designs with attention to detail
2. Implementing responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox
3. Integrating and customizing UI component libraries
4. Optimizing performance in Next.js applications
5. Using TypeScript for enhanced development experience


This RockstarGames clone project represents my journey in web development. Starting with the landing page, I'm building a foundation that showcases my growing skills in frontend technologies. As I continue to expand and refine this project, it will serve as a living portfolio of my progress in mastering modern web development techniques.

I'm excited to keep pushing my boundaries and adding new features. Stay tuned for regular updates as this project evolves!
